\begin{abstract}

    This state-of-art review paper will examine the latest Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) applicable for Small and Midsize Businesess (SMB), where SMB are as defined by Gartner\cite{gartner}.
    
    This review has 3 key objectives. Firstly, it will define and identify what kind of network security threats are most prevalent and most urgent for SMBs' to address. Secondly, we will identify what open source software are available for SMBs' to manage and mitigate identified threats. Then in the third final part, we will review how \sout{a select number of} these open source software \sout{and assess how well each system} addresses \sout{SMBs' from} the identified network threats.
    
    \begin{question}[Restructure Topic/Subtopic]
    Shall we separate section "D" from the introduction into its own topic? To match with the "3 objectives" mentioned  above...
    \end{question}
    
    Each tools' features, capabilities, advantages and limitations will be compared. How each system fare with regards to manageability, cost effectiveness and return of investment, will also be taken into consideration. With all above parameters being equal, should be able to determine which IDS/IPS are most suitable for SMBs'.
