\begin{abstract}

In this state-of-art review paper, we will examine the latest Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS) applicable for Small and Midsize Busnisess (SMB), where SMB are as defined by Gartner\cite{gartner}.

This review has 3 key objectives. Firstly, we will define and identify what kind of network security threats are most prevalent and most urgent for SMBs' to address. Secondly, we will identify what open source software are available for SMBs' to manage and mitigate identified threats. Then in the third final part, we will review a select number of these open source software and assess how well each system protects SMBs' from the identified network threats.

Each tools' features, capabilities, advantages and limitations will be compared. How each system fare with regards to managebility, cost effectiveness and return of investment also will be taken into consideration before we conclude which system will be crowned with a recommendation as IDS/IPS for SMBs'.
