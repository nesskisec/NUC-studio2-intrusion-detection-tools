\subsection{Snort, An Introduction}

As of 2022, there are 2 major versions of Snort installation base. Namely Snort 2.X and Snort 3.

There are 3 key, and perhaps the most noticable, differences between Snort 2 and Snort 3. It has to do with performance optimization, detection rules and software distribution. With regards to performance, Snort 3 code base has been refactored and optimized and it also now support multi-threading. Enabling Snort 3 to perform packet analysis multi-threaded. Snort 3 has also improved Rules syntax and parsing using LUA programming language \cite{}.
