\subsubsection{Suricata}

According to \cite{Reznik2021-mz} Suricata is the second most popular IDS tools used, only bypassed by SNORT in popularity. Containing features like hardware acceleration and multithreading to perform spesific functions more effectivley.

Suricata has according to Techfunnel article \cite{Techfunnel} all of the mentioned capabilities of OSSEC and is claimed to be fast and could also detect advanced threats. This capabilities are also supported by a literature review paper on IDS \cite{ozkan2021comprehensive} where the advantages of Suricata are mentioned along with additional benefits like filtered events and alarms, automatic protocol detection, application layer data collection to name a few. The downsides however are something that a small business should take into consideration as the CPU usage is high, and it has a smaller supported community compared to SNORT. The installation process is also mentioned as complex, and the need for special competence in this area for a small business may be needed.\\
