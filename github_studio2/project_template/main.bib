ABSTRACT = {Network-based intrusion detections become more difficult as Internet traffic is mostly encrypted. This paper introduces a method to detect encrypted malicious traffic based on the Transport Layer Security handshake and payload features without waiting for the traffic session to finish while preserving privacy. Our method, called TLS2Vec, creates words from the extracted features and uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for inference. We evaluated our method using traffic from three malicious applications and a benign application that we obtained from two publicly available datasets. Our results showed that TLS2Vec is promising as a tool to detect such malicious traffic.},

    abstract = {This chapter discusses intrusion detection and prevention technologies as a recognition strategy. The reason for intrusion detection systems (IDSs) is introduced; namely, that humans are too slow and network threats need to be addressed at network speed. Further, that the technology introduced in Chapter 5 as frustration strategies are not infallible, and an IDS is a method of auditing the success of frustration and resistance strategies. Given this motivation and that IDSs are important contributions to a layered defense, the chapter discusses several common pitfalls that can degrade IDS usefulness. These include problems of packet fragmentation, application reassembly, acting out of band, utilizing centrality effectively, and the base-rate fallacy. All IDSs have two basic modes of detection: signature based and anomaly based. The differences between these are introduced and the uses for each are discussed. Although the bulk of the chapter focuses on network IDSs, systems that use related but different data elements are also introduced: network behavior analyzers and wireless IDSs.}

@article{Courtland2017 ,
   abstract = {1 [edition]. Most philosophers and political scientists readily admit that Thomas Hobbes is a significant figure in the history of political thought. His theory was, arguably, one of the first to provide a justification for political legitimacy from the perspective of each individual subject. Many excellent books and articles have examined the justification and structure of Hobbes' commonwealth, ethical system, and interpretation of Christianity. What is troubling is that the Hobbesian project has been largely missing in the applied ethics and public policy literature. We often find applications of Kantian deontology, Bentham's or Mill's utilitarianism, Rawls's contractualism, the ethics of care, and various iterations of virtue ethics. Hobbesian accounts are routinely ignored and often derided. This is unfortunate because Hobbes's project offers a unique perspective. To ignore it, when such a perspective would be fruitful to apply to another set of theoretical questions, is a problem in need of a remedy. This volume seeks to eliminate (or, at the very least, partially fill) this gap in the literature. Not only will this volume appeal to those that are generally familiar with Hobbesian scholarship, it will also appeal to a variety of readers that are largely unfamiliar with Hobbes.},
